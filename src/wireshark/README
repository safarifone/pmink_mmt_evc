Release14 R14P Wireshark plugin
===============================

This is an example of how to create an ASN1_based plugin.

Under Linux:
1. replace each instance of "r14p" in Makefile.am to your plugin's name
2. add your plugin's name to ../Makefile.am
3. add your plugin's name to ../../configure.in
4. run autoreconf at top level
5. run make at top level (will automatically run configure)
6. your plugin should be complete

Under Windows:
1. replace each instance of "r14p" in Makefile.common to your plugin's name
2. replace each instance of "r14p" in moduleinfo.nmake to your plugin's name
3. add your plugin's name to ../Makefile.nmake
4. run make at top level 
5. your plugin should be complete
